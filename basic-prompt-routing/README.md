What is AIConfig? 
AIConfig saves prompts, models and model parameters as source-controlled configs. 
This is your generative AI artifact that can easily be shared across any application.
Use our SDK to connect an AIConfig to your application code. The separation of the generative
AI components from your application code reduces complexity, increase iteration, and promotes
better collaboration.
